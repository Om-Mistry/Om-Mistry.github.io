        <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>
        <ul>
          <p>Relationship between Javascript, HTML and CSS</p>
          <li>
            Imagine you're building a house, HTML is the blueprint of the house.
            It helps with making the structure and layout, like where the rooms,
            doors and windows are.
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS is the interior designer, it comes in and makes it look nice,
            decorates it and such.
          </li>
          <li>
            Javascript is the builder, who brings the house alive. Making the
            lights turn on and having the windows open and close.
          </li>
          <li>
            Like how a house needs all these things, a website needs all three,
            HTML, CSS and Javascript to work properly
          </li>
          <p>Control Flow and Loops example</p>
          <li>
            Control flow and loops is like cooking something. You have a recipe
            and you need to follow a set of steps to make it. Control flow is
            following the steps for the cooking recipe in order, frying
            something, then adding some spices and then plating it up. Each step
            requires the previous one and you can't skip any of them if you want
            the meal to be yummy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Loops are like a repetitive task, lets say if you're making pasta
            then you have to roll the pasta properly each time. This is a loop
            as you're doing the same thing everytime for that step.
          </li>
          <p>Understanding the Dom</p>
          <li>
            The DOM actually means the Document Object Model and it is a
            programming interface for developing web documents such as websites.
            It represents the document in a tree-like structure where each node
            has some data and then has a related node. Each node also represents
            an element and the DOM provides us with a way of interacting with it
            allowing us to change and work on it how we please.
          </li>
          <p>Accessing data from arrays and objects</p>
          <li>
            Arrays are like a shopping list, it's a bunch of items listed
            somewhere and you have to retrieve them in the specific aisle
            they're in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Objects are like dictionaries, each item has a key value. Like a
            word and it's definition. You choose an item by specifing the key
            it's assigned with.
          </li>
          <p>Explaining functions and their importance</p>
          <li>
            Functions are reusable sets of instructions that perform a specific
            task, they let you break your code down into smaller pieces and
            reuse them whenever and however you need.
          </li>
          <li>
            An example of this is if you're making waffles, instead of writing
            the recipe down everytime you make them, you instead learn the
            recipe off by heart and then whenever you need to make pancakes you
            call the function(Remember the recipe).
          </li>
          <li>
            Functions are also helpful because they make it easy to reuse code
            and make it easier to maintain and debug your code. Instead of
            writing large blocks of code you can make something into a function
            and call it when needed.
