    Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
    values and identity. Something very important for me and my culture. Is how
    very important family is. Family is among the most important things for me.
    I want to be able to care completely for my grandparents, Mum, Dad, cousins,
    Aunts, Uncles and brother. They’re all extremely important for me and the
    thought of spending special bonding time with them is great. That’s why I’m
    so very family focused, this also links up with education and jobs. I want
    to have the best education and job opportunities possible so I can provide
    for them. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
    learning journey. My strengths I would say are being resilient, always
    trying my 100%, never giving up and trying to help others when I can. I’m
    resilient because no matter how much I’ve struggled or failed at something.
    I will always be getting up back off my feet and going again and again.
    Trying my best to learn and understand what I failed to do so in the past.
    This is why I’m also always trying my 100%, I always try my best to get
    something done and hate it when I must submit something that’s not done
    properly. Making sure everything is correct and done properly is a huge
    thing for me, I want to make sure everything I learn and do is proper. Also,
    when it comes to helping others. If I am experienced and knowledgeable in a
    subject, I will always try my best to find some time and help them. However
    I must be able to help myself understand it first, I would hate to be
    teaching someone something that’s incorrect.
