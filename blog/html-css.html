          Margins are the space outside the border of an element. The distance
          between the element's border and what is surrounding it. The purpose
          is to control the spacing between elements on a page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Border is the line that surrounds the element and it defines the
          boundary. The purpose is to add a visible boundary around the element
          so it can be easy to seperate content
        </li>
        <li>
          Padding is the space between the content and the border of another
          element, it's purpose is to control the spacing for the content
