    Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
    How might these affect your learning journey? Some limitations are that I
    can get frustrated quite easily and that I can also be distracted easily.
    These can easily negatively impact my learning journey however I am in the
    process of changing myself and giving myself more chances to study in an
    isolated quiet area without distractions. This will allow me to reduce the
    risk of distractions quite easily. And when it comes to frustration, I will
    limit it by doing different activities, going outside, getting some exercise
    and taking small breaks before coming back and diving deep into what I did
    wrong and what I have to fix.
