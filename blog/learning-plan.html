      <h1>My Learning Plan!</h1>
      <ul>
        <p>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
        <li>
          1. My long term goal at the moment is to learn and become profficient
          in coding. Website development and such. I would really love to be
          able to find a job in this skillset because even though I haven't done
          much of it, the stuff I have done I really did enjoy. I really would
          love to find a very stable job that I can use as a way to increase my
          growth.
        </li>
        <p>
          2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </p>
        <li>
          2. My strengths are dedication to putting in the time and effort for
          whatever job I have to do. Always trying my best when I am learning
          and working on something. I want to be the most effective learner and
          I will always be at the top of my game trying my absolute best to gain
          the skills I need to achieve that!
        </li>
        <p>
          3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </p>
        <li>
          3. Some human skills I'd like to develop would be, understanding and
          reading people's feelings and thoughts better. Being able to give
          advice and help them when they're struggling with something. Also how
          to let them know most effectively about my ideas and what I'm thinking
          of.
        </li>
        <p>
          4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
          programme. This should include:
        </p>
        <li>
          4. I will manage my workload most affectively by giving myself certain
          times where I will be doing certain things. This will allow me to work
          productively in the timeslot I've allocated for myself. Balancing
          working on my studies and working on myself is also important to me,
          making sure I have time where I can rest and recover, while also
          making sure I don't slack regarding study. When things are starting to
          build up and get to me, I will reach out for help, letting staff know
          I am struggling and that I could possibly need extra time and help.
          Also making sure I set little goals that I can achieve easily as this
          would give me momentum and I should easily be able to finish my tasks
          at the end of the day.
        </li>
        <p>
          5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </p>
        <li>
          5. I will seek help by asking all and every question I have in the
          helpdesk channels. Making sure I gain the understand that I need to be
          able to finish the tasks. If it's a more personal trouble then I will
          ask one of the staff in direct messages for some assistance/guidance
          in that aspect.
        </li>
        <p>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
        <li>
          6. I expect the Facilitation team to be here to help during the proper
          hours. I understand that they have lives and work to do as well so
          their responses don't have to be immediate. They should be there to
          help and assist the students in however way they can in relation to
          the course. Making sure everyone understands things to the best of
          their ability and not leaving any students out to dry.
        </li>
        <p>
          7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau
          commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </p>
        <li>
          7. Around 2-3pm is when I usually go to the gym, 5-7pm is when I
          usually have dinner and spend time with my family. Otherwise I am free
          on most days.
