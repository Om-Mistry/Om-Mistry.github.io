      <h1>My identity and Values!</h1>
      <p>
        1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
        how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
        you made and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I can remember one ethical decision where I was driving, and I had the
          choice to let someone go by in-front of me. I weighed up the values
          involved, and I thought to myself about it. Is it safe to let them in?
          Yes, it was. Would I be late or frustrated if I let them in? No, I
          wouldn’t be, would someone else around me be frustrated or late? No
          there was no one behind me. So, I just let them in, simple, safe and
          everyone was happy. Looking back at my choice now I think about it and
          I’m very happy with how it went down.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
        your values and identity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Something very important for me and my culture. Is how very important
          family is. Family is among the most important things for me. I want to
          be able to care completely for my grandparents, Mum, Dad, cousins,
          Aunts, Uncles and brother. They’re all extremely important for me and
          the thought of spending special bonding time with them is great.
          That’s why I’m so very family focused, this also links up with
          education and jobs. I want to have the best education and job
          opportunities possible so I can provide for them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          My strengths I would say are being resilient, always trying my 100%,
          never giving up and trying to help others when I can. I’m resilient
          because no matter how much I’ve struggled or failed at something. I
          will always be getting up back off my feet and going again and again.
          Trying my best to learn and understand what I failed to do so in the
          past. This is why I’m also always trying my 100%, I always try my best
          to get something done and hate it when I must submit something that’s
          not done properly. Making sure everything is correct and done properly
          is a huge thing for me, I want to make sure everything I learn and do
          is proper. Also, when it comes to helping others. If I am experienced
          and knowledgeable in a subject, I will always try my best to find some
          time and help them. However I must be able to help myself understand
          it first, I would hate to be teaching someone something that’s
          incorrect.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some limitations are that I can get frustrated quite easily and that I
          can also be distracted easily. These can easily negatively impact my
          learning journey however I am in the process of changing myself and
          giving myself more chances to study in an isolated quiet area without
          distractions. This will allow me to reduce the risk of distractions
          quite easily. And when it comes to frustration, I will limit it by
          doing different activities, going outside, getting some exercise and
          taking small breaks before coming back and diving deep into what I did
          wrong and what I have to fix.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I haven’t really worked much with people before, and when I have
          worked with people it all went smoothly. However, some strategies I
          can think of that could be utilized would be. Letting everyone express
          how they’re feeling and why, things that could be done to solve the
          way they’re feeling and such. This would let the whole group know how
          everyone is feeling and it would allow us to think of ways to fix the
          problems we’re experiencing! Another way would be to have everyone
          think together about who gets assigned what work and how much workload
          each person gets. Everyone should have the same amount of work and
          stuff like that.
